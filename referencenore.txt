==========
Make it run permanently in background:
1. Stop the current app:
bashCtrl+C
2. Run it in background with nohup:
bashsudo nohup ./venv/bin/python run_server.py > app.log 2>&1 &
3. Check it's running:
bashps aux | grep python
You should see your Python process running.
4. Exit PuTTY and test:
Close PuTTY completely and test http://139.185.44.125/ - it should still work!
📋 Useful commands for management:
To stop the app:
bashsudo pkill -f run_server.py
To check if it's running:
bashps aux | grep python
To see the logs:
bashtail -f app.log
To restart after updates:
bashsudo pkill -f run_server.py
sudo nohup ./venv/bin/python run_server.py > app.log 2>&1 &
Run the nohup command now and then close PuTTY to test! 🎯RetryIA^C(venv) ubuntu@tile-optimization-app:~/tile-optimization-v2$ sudo nohup ./venv/bin/python run_server.py > app.log 2>&1 &
